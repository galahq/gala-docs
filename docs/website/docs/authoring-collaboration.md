title: Collaborating with Others

Sustainability education, like sustainability more generally, is too much for one person to do alone.
That’s why Gala allows you to create a case in collaboration with a team.
You can invite as many collaborators as you want to edit the case with you.

## Adding collaborators

To add collaborators to a case you’re creating with Gala, you’ll need to know the email address they signed up with.
In your case’s “Options” menu, choose “Edit Case Settings.”
On the right side of the case settings page, you’ll see a list labeled “Case editors.”
Click “Add Collaborator” and enter your teammate’s email address.

That’s all it takes.
Now, when your partner logs into Gala, they will have access to your case in their “My Cases” list.
Collaborators on Gala are, at least for now, always equal in ability: your collaborator has all the same ability you do to change your case.
Be sure only to add someone you trust.

## Simultaneous editing

You and your collaborators _can_ edit the same case at the same time.
However, to prevent you from overwriting each others changes accidentally, only one of you can edit a given component at any time.
When your collaborator starts to make changes to a particular card or Edgenote, it will be locked and you’ll have to wait until they finish.
Then you’ll see their changes to the component and it will be unlocked.

If someone loses connection before their browser can release their lock on an element, you do have the ability to proceed despite the lock.
For example, if you see that your collaborator started editing a card three hours ago and hasn’t finished, it is probably safe to proceed.
You can always click “Edit Anyway” and bypass the lock.
