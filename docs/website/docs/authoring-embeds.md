This is a running list of media sources that are known to be embeddedable in Gala, meaning that a widget will be viewable or interactable directly from the case.

This isn't an exhaustive list. To see if a source will embed try pasting its URL in the edgenote editor and Gala will detect if it is able to be embedded. If embedding is unavailable for a given URL, you can always link out to the page with the content you want.

Use the direct URL (copying from the address bar typically works), not the "embed" URL, which begins with an HTML tag such as `<iframe>`.
