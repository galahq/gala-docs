## Licenses available on Gala

Authors publishing a module on Gala have a choice between the following Creative Commons licenses:

- **[Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/)** (_CC BY-NC-SA 4.0_) – This license allows others to share and adapt a module for [non-commercial purposes](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/NonCommercial_interpretation), as long as they give proper credit. Any adapted versions of the module must carry the same license.

- **[Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/)** (_CC BY-NC-ND 4.0_) – This license is similar to the CC BY-NC-SA license but it does not permit others to adapt or repurpose your module.

Some modules may be licensed *All Rights Reserved*. Modules with this license were either created before the introduction of the Creative Commons Licenses or by authors belonging to institutions that have made special arrangements with Gala.

## Setting/viewing a module's license

Module licenses are displayed at the bottom of the module overview page.

New modules default to the *Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike* license. This can be changed from the module settings menu, which is accesible from the menu in the top right-hand corner of the screen (Options > Edit module settings).

## FAQ

- ### What constitutes commercial use?
  See [this guide from Wikimedia Commons](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/NonCommercial_interpretation) for guidance.

- ### Can I use my own module for commercial purposes?
  Yes, the guide above notes that "the NonCommercial limitation applies to licensed uses only and does not restrict use by the licensor."

- ### What is proper attribution?
  See [this guide from creativecommons.org](https://creativecommons.org/faq/#attribution) for more information.

- ### How are modules adapted?
  We are working to create a simple workflow for adapting modules on Gala that streamlines attribution and doesn't clutter-up search results.
  
  In the meantime, we generally handle the adaptation process manually for our partners. Gala currently lets module authors create copies of their module and assign additional authors (from the _Module settings_ menu), so this is an option if you are in contact with someone who would like to modify a copy of your module. Keep in mind that (in the case of licenses such as _CC BY-NC-SA 4.0_ that allow adaptation) others may modify your work and make it available on other platforms.
