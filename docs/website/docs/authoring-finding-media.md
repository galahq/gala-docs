## Attribution

When adding an image or figure as an edgenote, make sure to include proper attribution, even if it’s your own work. [This wiki has detailed information about attribution](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Best_practices_for_attribution) and Creative Commons licenses. Ideally, you should note the title, author, source, and license.

Gala's form for adding edgenotes has a "photo credit" field for attribution information. If you are hosting content elsewhere (such as an interactive map or timeline), or uploading a document that includes outside work (such as Creative Commons images), include the attribution within the work you are uploading or linking to. When including a podcast in your case via the podcast page, include any attributions for the audio either within the podcast itself or on the podcast page.

## Navigating Copyright

When authoring a case/module on Gala you agree to abide by all applicable copyright laws. This is something you will need to consider when adding embedded media content, such as images, audio clips, and documents. Fortunately, in most cases it is fine to link to a work that someone else has made available publicly online (but do doublecheck that the website you are linking-to is not itself violating copyright). _Please note that nothing on this page should be construed as legal advice._

If you intend to upload media content to Gala, or host the content elsewhere and link to it from your case, you should ensure that it meets one of the following conditions:

### Non-copyrightable works

Some works are not copyrightable. This usually includes things like raw data, and simple charts and tables. According to the University of Michigan Library’s Copyright Guide, “Unless they possess a modicum of creativity, charts, graphs, and tables are not subject to copyright protection, because they are purely factual. Thus, they do not meet the originality requirement.” This also means that you can recreate tables and graphs if you have access to the same data. For more information, [consult the guide here](https://guides.lib.umich.edu/copyrightbasics/copyrightability).

### Public Domain

You may also use works that are no longer under copyright, usually due to either age, (e.g., Audubon bird paintings), because they were never under copyright (most U.S. government works for use in U.S.), or because the author has explicitly placed them in the public domain (often indicated with a “CC-0” license). [This guide from Stanford Libraries](https://fairuse.stanford.edu/overview/public-domain/welcome/#:~:text=The%20term%20%E2%80%9Cpublic%20domain%E2%80%9D%20refers,one%20can%20ever%20own%20it) has more information.

### Creative Commons

Creative Commons allows for the easy licensing of works (e.g., images) for usage. [There are six licenses](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/) that the author of a work may use to retain certain restrictions to use (whether the work can be modified or used commercially, for example), but all of the licenses allow you to redistribute the work for non-commercial purposes, as long as you provide proper attribution.  

### Fair use

If the use of a copyrighted work meets certain conditions it may be considered fair use. Keep in mind that copyright laws are more restrictive of content used in online courses than in face-to-face courses and that educational or non-profit use is only one of multiple factors that go in murky process of [deciding whether content is fair use](https://guides.lib.umich.edu/c.php?g=283105&p=6687646). Understand that Gala may remove materials that are determined to be in violation of copyright.

### Obtaining permission to use copyrighted works

Should you wish to include an image or figure that does not meet these conditions, you will need to obtain explicit written permission to use the image. See the [sample request letter here](https://www.lib.umich.edu/files/services/copyright/Request_Permission_Copies.doc). There is often a fee associated with this, and the process can be time consuming. Your institution's library may be able to help you with the process.

## Creative Commons and Public Domain media sources
