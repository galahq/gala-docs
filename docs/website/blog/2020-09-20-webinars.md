In a series of online discussions held during the pandemic lockdown, "Making the Case for Sustainability" takes you behind the scenes with the faculty, students, and alumni of SEAS as they partner with high profile professionals, entrepreneurs, civic leaders, justice advocates and artists to address specific environmental and social challenges. In frank, informal conversations, moderator Professor Rebecca Hardin, of the University of Michigan School for Environment and Sustainability (SEAS) asks how these teams enact concrete sustainability interventions, track their impacts, and incorporate that learning back into SEAS virtual and residential learning environments.
