[Perrin Selcer](https://lsa.umich.edu/history/people/faculty/pselcer.html), an associate professor in History and director of the Science, Technology and Society Program at the University of Michigan, recently published an article, ["Finding Balance Through Technology," in the Michigan LSA History department's Digital Pedagogy Blog](https://lsa.umich.edu/history/news-events/all-news/digital-pedagogy-blog/finding-balance-through-technology.html).

Perrin writes of the Gala platform:

> Fortunately, the Gala platform is so intuitive and well-designed that it enabled students to construct slick, easily navigable multimedia webpages without worrying about the technology. I have had some success using commercial website templates for student projects in other classes, but they can encourage frustratingly superficial cut-and-paste jobs that resemble bad Wikipedia entries. With Gala, the pedagogical philosophy is built into the platform. The multimedia components are visually integrated so as to enhance, not replace, the written narrative. At the center of each case is a story. Not only do the projects end up looking publishable, but students add their final products to a gallery of polished undergraduate-generated cases that set a high standard.

The article highlights two cases produced by undergraduates in Perrin's class:

- [United Fruit Companyâ€™s Struggles with Sustainability](https://www.learngala.com/cases/0288a456-cb0a-4c38-b31f-3f2a60348ebf/)
- [Indigenous Rights and Resource Development along the Northern Sea Route](https://www.learngala.com/cases/e6900f35-3448-41f9-91a1-a60d30c8dde8)
