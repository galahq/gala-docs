Gala is a partner on a [recently awarded Public Interest Technology "University Challenge" grant](https://seas.umich.edu/news/big-tech-faces-scrutiny-24-universities-get-36m-major-foundations-fuel-inclusive-public):

> The grant to the University of Michigan (U-M) was awarded to principal investigator Rebecca Hardin, an associate professor at U-M’s School for Environment and Sustainability (SEAS). The grant supports a collaboration between Hardin and a civil and environmental engineering team under the direction of Lutgarde Raskin, a professor at U-M’s College of Engineering. Building on the doctoral research of U-M student Matt Vedrin, with support from the National Science Foundation-funded Midwest Big Data Hub, the project uses U-M’s homegrown open source/open access learning platform learngala.com for data-rich learning tools. In collaboration with SEAS professor Kyle Whyte, partners from the City of Ann arbor, the BlueConduit startup, and U-M’s Blue Sky Initiative for water sector engagement, the team will look toward making responsive low-barrier-to-use learning tools created for classrooms, communities and workforces facing challenges in the monitoring and improvement of quality drinking water distribution systems. These tools can be shared among utilities in cities like Michigan’s Benton Harbor and Flint—and eventually, shared with rural communities and tribal water utilities.
