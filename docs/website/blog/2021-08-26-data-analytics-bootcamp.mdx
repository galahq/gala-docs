A new virtual bootcamp on Data Visualization with RShiny is [now available, free, from Gala](https://about.learngala.com/data-analytics/index.html).

The bootcamp provides anyone with minimal R coding experience resources and guidance to develop a first web application focused on data visualization. It was created by recent MBDH fellow Rahul Agrawal Bejarano (UM), who worked with mentors Charles Willis (U Minnesota) and Jeff Klemens (Jefferson University) to create an immersive R shiny data learning feature about the ecology of East Africa's Serengeti on _learngala.com_ [available here](https://www.learngala.com/cases/5404912d-6d4c-4a37-a777-0f80e6a7912f). Rahul went on to create this virtual "bootcamp" for others seeking to innovate with R Shiny for more immersive, inclusive data learning tools

To launch the bootcamp, Gala hosted a webinar [Inclusion and Innovation in Data Learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UQSia65eLs)
The webinar offers brief background on the Midwest Big Data Hub Learning Fellows Program with MBDH Executive Director John MacMullen and UMich Faculty Advisor Rebecca Hardin as well as Program Manager Ed Waisanen. Rahul's mentors, and educational specialist Suzanne Macey of the American Museum of Natural History comment-on and ask questions about the tool.
