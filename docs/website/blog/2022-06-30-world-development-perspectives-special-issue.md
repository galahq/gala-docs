These cases "reflect the rising status of cases as well as the innovations underway in their distribution, teaching, and form." These featured cases include:

- “[Encroaching Cities](https://www.learngala.com/cases/changing-a-leopards-spots),” by M. Vikas, Vidya Athreya, and Sunil Limaye. "About how the expansion of Mumbai, India, toward protected areas on the outskirts of the city has escalated conflict between humans and wildlife."
