A recent University of Michigan School for Environment and Sustainability news piece, [Growing the SEAS Gala Learning Platform with NSF Support](https://seas.umich.edu/news/growing-seas-gala-learning-platform-nsf-support), highlights ongoing NSF support for Gala's work:

> All of these recent funding opportunities support Gala’s organic growth in content and community, both by supporting faculty and graduate students from U-M and other campuses to collaborate toward enhanced online offerings, both through new models of mentorship and through the actual coding of cutting-edge integrations with software such as Rshiny, Jupyter Notebooks, and more. The platform thus becomes a community where software skills, sustainability content, and socially inclusive learning and professional development combine to create more adaptive, accessible tools for learners of many backgrounds. Current resources, such as those relating to Michigan’s spectacular freshwater resources, and even a new crop of cases from users at North Carolina State University on the microbiology of biofuels processing, are being translated into other languages through a partnership with the U-M Language Resource Center and its “Translate-a-thon.” Making case studies available in additional languages invites diverse learners to take part in the program’s cross-cutting collaborative sustainability research.
