Gala now supports embedding RShiny apps hosted on [shinyapps.io](https://www.shinyapps.io/). You can add RShiny apps to your case [as you would with any edgenote](https://docs.learngala.com/docs/authoring-embedding-media.html). (just make sure to toggle "Allow this Edgenote to take up the full width of the page.")
