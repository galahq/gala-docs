We are now accepting applications for our second cohort of [Midwest Big Data Hub Learning Innovation Fellows](https://midwestbigdatahub.org/mbdh-learning-innovation-fellows-program/)!

This semester-long paid fellowship is open to grad and undergrad students at Midwest colleges and universities interested in data analytics and sustainability. This work places fellows with small teams to enhance learning modules on Gala, in collaboration with faculty leaders with experience developing Open Educational Resources (OER) such as QubesHub. Fellows collaborate to create integrations and features that make learning modules more accessible and powerful for those interested in data analytics.

See the [call for applications](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sNLq46T59jpAMIhKFI-8JUN1JQah5hWLAvrOfViVlbQ/edit?usp=sharing) for more information about the program].
