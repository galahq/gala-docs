Members of OCELOTS (Online Content for Experiential Learning of Tropical Systems) have a new perspective out in PLOS Biology, calling for participatory online learning modules in biology education:

> We posit that online modules created by tropical researchers themselves will bring the flavor and excitement of authentic research into the classroom in a way that sparks interest in global biological issues, without requiring travel. Online modules that can be easily created by researchers, and that immerse learners in real-world tropical research are urgently needed.

The commentary also highlights the role of Gala in facilitating the production and adaptation of these modules:

> Because researchers may lack experience in creating OERs, a critical component in OCELOTS is the platform itself—Gala—intentionally designed to be user-friendly, open-source, and open-access, such that anyone with internet access can author a module.
