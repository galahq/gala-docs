# v1.12: Catalog Redesign

This release redesigns the catalog to make it easier to see what cases are available and to find one that meets your needs. We now display six featured cases with large images, an interactive map of case locations, and a readable list of the cases youâ€™re enrolled in on the sidebar. (#113, #129, #131, #133, #136)
