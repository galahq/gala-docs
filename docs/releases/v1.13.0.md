# v1.13: Search

This release adds search functionality to our case library, and lays the groundwork for the days that we host cases from libraries around the world. The full text of all the cases can be searched for any keyword; we’re using Postgres `ts_vectors` in a materialized view to keep that fast. The search results view is also able to handle “subindexes” of all the cases from a given library, or later all the cases from a given stack or category. (#161)
